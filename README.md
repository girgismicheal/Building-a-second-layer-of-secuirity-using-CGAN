### This project uses and explain how to use GANs with tabular data not only with images

## Overview
Fake task attack is critical for Mobile Crowdsensing system (MCS) that aim to clog the sensing servers in the MCS platform and drain more energy from participantsâ€™ smart devices. Typically, fake tasks are created by empirical model such as CrowdSenSim tool. Recently, cyber criminals deploy more intelligent mechanisms to create attacks. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the most powerful techniques to generate synthetic samples. GAN considers the entire data in the training dataset to create similar samples. This project aims to use GAN to create fake tasks and verify fake task detection performance.<br>

# Project Steps:

1. Prepare the dataset For training
2. Implement classic classifiers (Adaboost and RF) and train them
3. Verify detection performance using test dataset and compare the results
4. Implement Conditional GAN with Wasserstein loss [2].
5. Train the CGAN on the training dataset
6. Generate synthetic fake tasks via Generator network in CGAN after the training procedure
7. Mix the generated fake tasks with the original test dataset to obtain a new test dataset
8. Obtain Adaboost and RF detection performance using the new test dataset and compare the results
9. Consider the Discriminator to as the first level classifier and RF/Adaboost as the second level classifier
